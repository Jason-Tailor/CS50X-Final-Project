# CS50X-Final-Project
As part of HarvardXâ€™s CS50x Introduction to Computer Science, I developed a third-person parkour project in Unity for the final project. I integrated multiple assets and plugins, including the Dynamic Parkour Plugin, to implement climbing, vaulting, sliding, and jumping mechanics, while building levels and characters into a cohesive, playable demo.
